**Fireworks Display Logic (fireworks.js)**

The fireworks.js script controls:

	â€¢	Canvas Rendering: Dynamically resizes the canvas and displays fireworks on user clicks.
	â€¢	Fireworks Effects: Different styles of fireworks, with randomized explosions and sparkling messages.
	â€¢	Audio Effects: Plays launch and explosion sounds for added realism.

**Form Submission Handling (contact.html)**

	â€¢	Data Submission to Google Sheets: Sends contact form data to Google Sheets via Google Apps Script.
	â€¢	Session Storage Check: Ensures the thank-you page is accessible only after a valid form submission.
	â€¢	Redirect with Countdown: Displays a countdown on the thank-you page and redirects to the homepage.

Smooth Redirection on Thank-You Page (thankyou.html)

**On the thank-you page:**

	â€¢	Displays a success message with a countdown.
	â€¢	Smoothly redirects back to the homepage.

**Thank-You Page**
